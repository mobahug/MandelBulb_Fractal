# MandelBulb_Fractal

The Mandelbulb is a three-dimensional fractal, constructed for the first time in 1997 by Jules Ruis and in 2009 further developed by Daniel White and Paul Nylander using spherical coordinates.

A canonical 3-dimensional Mandelbrot set does not exist, since there is no 3-dimensional analogue of the 2-dimensional space of complex numbers. It is possible to construct Mandelbrot sets in 4 dimensions using quaternions and bicomplex numbers.

MandelBulb got my interest just about a week ago when I was browsing on youtube. The mesmerizing form got many more new shape since it was made originally.

I really liked this project, because the ready dots, which forming the mandelbulb remembering me as if I would make a small cluster of stars.
